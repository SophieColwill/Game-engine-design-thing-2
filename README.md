This week's asycronis content spoke about two different methods you can use to get more out of the game engine, those being Singleton & the Factory method.
Singletons are persistent information that stays through-out your game, and can only have 1 in existence.
The factory method is essentially Inheritence, but the class it is inheriting from was made to only be the framework for the child classes.

Reflection:
I think I did rather well with implementing all of the stuff. All the times I got stuck were not on problems with the new stuff, but rather my rush for time making me make simple mistakes that I really should have known better than to do.
